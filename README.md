# Switchboard

Your command center for Claude Code sessions.

Switchboard is a desktop app that gives you a unified view of all your Claude Code sessions across every project. Launch, resume, fork, and monitor sessions from a single window — no more juggling terminal tabs or digging through `~/.claude/projects` to find that one conversation from last week.

### Key Features

- **Session Browser** — All your Claude Code sessions, organized by project, searchable by content
- **Built-in Terminal** — Connect to running sessions or launch new ones without leaving the app
- **Status Notifications** — In-app alerts when a session is waiting for permission approval or user input
- **Fork & Resume** — Branch off from any point in a session's history
- **Full-Text Search** — Find any session by what was discussed, not just when it happened
- **IDE Emulation** — Switchboard acts as an IDE for Claude CLI, showing file diffs and opens in a side panel where you can accept, reject, or edit changes before they're applied. Supports both inline and side-by-side diff views. Disable this in Global Settings if you prefer Claude to use your own editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- **Plans & Memory** — Browse and edit your plan files and CLAUDE.md memory in one place
- **Activity Stats** — Heatmap of your coding activity across all projects
- **Session Names** — Picks up session names from Claude Code's `/rename` command automatically

## IDE Emulation

Switchboard can act as an IDE for your Claude Code sessions. When enabled, Claude's file opens and proposed edits appear in a side panel next to the terminal instead of being sent to an external editor.

- **Diff review** — When Claude proposes a file change, it shows up as a diff in the side panel. You can review the changes and accept or reject them directly.
- **Inline & side-by-side** — Toggle between inline (unified) and side-by-side diff views. Your preference is remembered across sessions.
- **Partial acceptance** — In inline mode, you can accept or reject individual chunks within a diff, then submit the final result.
- **File viewer** — Clickable file links in terminal output (OSC 8 hyperlinks) open in the side panel with syntax highlighting.

To disable IDE emulation entirely (e.g. if you want Claude to use VS Code or Cursor instead), uncheck **IDE Emulation** in **Global Settings**. This stops Switchboard from registering as an IDE, so Claude CLI will discover and connect to your real editor. Changes take effect on new sessions — running sessions are not affected.

## Status Notifications

Switchboard monitors all your sessions in the background and shows status indicators in the sidebar so you can tell at a glance which sessions need attention — even when you're working in a different one.

- **Waiting for input** — A session that needs your response is highlighted so you don't miss it.
- **Permission approval** — When Claude is blocked waiting for a permission grant, the session badge lets you know immediately.
- **Activity indicators** — See which sessions are actively running, idle, or finished.

## Download

Grab the latest release for your platform:

**[Download Switchboard](https://github.com/doctly/switchboard/releases/latest)**

- **macOS**: `.dmg` (Apple Silicon & Intel)
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` or `.deb`

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **npm** 10+
- Platform build tools for native modules:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - **Linux**: `build-essential`, `python3` (`sudo apt install build-essential python3`)
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools or `npm install -g windows-build-tools`

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (runs postinstall automatically)
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

`npm start` bundles CodeMirror and launches Electron. For faster iteration after the first run:

```bash
npm run electron
```

## Building

All build commands bundle CodeMirror first, then invoke electron-builder.

```bash
# Current platform
npm run build

# Platform-specific
npm run build:mac     # DMG + zip (arm64 + x64)
npm run build:win     # NSIS installer (x64 + arm64)
npm run build:linux   # AppImage + deb (x64 + arm64)
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## Releasing

Releases are driven by git tags:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow builds for all platforms and publishes to GitHub Releases. You can also release locally:

```bash
npm run release   # builds + publishes to GitHub Releases
```

Set `GH_TOKEN` in your environment (a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope).

## Auto-Updates

The app uses `electron-updater` to check for updates from GitHub Releases on launch and every 4 hours. Updates are only checked in packaged builds (not during development). The flow:

1. App auto-downloads updates in the background
2. A toast notification appears when the update is ready
3. User can restart immediately or dismiss (installs on next quit)

## Code Signing

For distribution, set these environment variables:

- **macOS**: `CSC_LINK` (p12 certificate) and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, or sign via Keychain
- **Windows**: `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` for EV/OV code signing
- Set `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` to skip signing (CI artifact builds)

The macOS build uses custom entitlements (`build/entitlements.mac.plist`) to allow JIT and unsigned memory execution, required by native modules (node-pty, better-sqlite3).
